## 3. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key concepts
- **Primary Key**: 
  - Uniquely identifies each record in a table
  - Cannot contain NULL values
  - Only one primary key per table
- **Foreign Key**:
  - Creates a relationship between two tables
  - References the primary key of another table
  - Enforces referential integrity

```sql
